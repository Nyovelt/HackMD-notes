### Buffer overflow FTW
- Success! Program crashed!
    - Exploit: any string longer than buffer size
- Success! Execute arbitrary code!
    - Exploit: injected code + address of buffer
- Success! Open a shell!
    - Exploit: nop sled + shellcode + guesses of buffer 
    
### First lesson: avoid unsafe functions
- Unsafe functions:
    - strcpy and friends (str*)
    - sprintf
    - gets
- Safe versions:
    - strncpy and friends (strn*)
    - snprintf
    - fgets
- Does not solve all problem
